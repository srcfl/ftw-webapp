// Vendored from srcfl/ftw web/components/price-strip.js at da6a1018.
// Do not edit here — change it upstream and re-copy. The app and the
// box's own dashboard render this exact file; that is the point.
// Geometry for the compact price strip: each slot's price drawn as a bar
// from zero, a miniature of the full chart one tap away.
//
// It used to draw each slot's deviation from the window's mean instead,
// so the fixed grid tariff could not flatten the shape. That traded away
// the one convention every bar chart teaches — height is amount. The
// cheapest morning drew the TALLEST bars (hanging below the line), so the
// strip and the full chart read the same day in opposite directions. Bars
// now rise from zero exactly like the full chart's, and the mean survives
// as a reference line at its own height rather than as the baseline.
//
// Colour never carries the message alone (the theme's green and red sit
// ΔE 2.4 apart under deuteranopia, against a threshold of 8): height is
// the price, the mean line is the cheap/dear reference a bar's top is
// read against, and colour only reinforces that — the strip still works
// in greyscale.
//
// Pure geometry, no DOM: the caller renders and the tests import it.

// Returns null when there is nothing to draw, else
// { zeroY, meanY, mean, bars: [{x, y, w, h, tone, current}], W, H }.
//
// `tone` is "dear"/"cheap" by side of the mean, "flat" within 5 % of the
// price span (a slot that is neither, and shouldn't be pushed onto one
// side of the palette), and "negative" below zero — priced to be taken,
// a different category from "cheapest today", as on the full chart.
